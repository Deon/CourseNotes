# Organizing Production

## The Firm and its Economic Problem
*Firm* - An institution that hires factors of production, using them to produce/sell goods and services.

Firms aim to *maximize profit* If they fail to do so, they usually are eliminated or bought out. 

Accountants measure profit to ensure the proper amount of tax is paid, and to show investors how money is used. They use Revenue Canada rules. 

Profit = Revenue - Costs.

Economic Profit = Revenue - Total Cost (Opportunity Cost of Production)

We also want to maximize Economic Profit. 

### Opportunity Cost of Production
Value of the best alternative use of resources. 

Sum of the cost of using resources:

- Bought in the market
- Owned by the firm
- Supplied by the firm's owner. 

#### Resources Bought in the Market
Amount spent by a firm on resources bought in the market is an opportunity cost of production as the firm could have bought different resources to produce another good/service.

#### Resources Owned by the Firm
If the firm uses capital to produce output; that's an opportunity cost, as it could have sold its capital and rented capital from another firm. By using its capital, it implicitly rents from itself; the **implicit rental rate** of capital.

It's made up of:

1. Economic Depreciation (change in *market value* of capital)
2. Interest forgone (return on funds used to secure capital)

#### Resources Supplied by the Firm's Owner
The owner can supply *entrepreneurship* and/or *labour*.

Return to entreprenurship = profit. On average, this is the **normal profit**. This is the cost of entrepreneurship and an opportunity cost of production.

The owner may not take a wage (but can supply labour) - the opportunity cost of this is the **wage income** forgone by not taking the best alternative job.

### The Firm's Decisions
To maximize profit, firms must make 5 decisions:

1. What to produce, and in what quantities
2. How to produce
3. How to organize/compensate managers/employees
4. How to market and price products
5. What to produce itself, and what to buy

### The Firm's Constraints
Profit is limited by:

1. Technology Constraints
2. Information Constraints
3. Market Constraints

#### Technology Constraints

Technology is any method of producing goods/services, which evolves over time.

Using current tech, firms can only produce more only if it hires more resources - increasing costs and limiting profits.

#### Information Constraints
Firms are limited by incomplete information about the quality/effort of its workforce, current/future buying plans of customers, and plans of competitors. The cost of coping with limited info limits profits.

#### Market Constraints

What a firm can sell and at what price is limited by their customers' willingness to pay and the prices/marketing of competitors. 

The resources a firm can buy and the prices it pays are limited by the willingness of people who work and invest in the form.

The expenditures that a firm incurs to overcome these market limitations limit the profit.

## Technology and Economic Efficiency

#### Technological Efficiency
This occurs when the firm uses the least inputs to produce a given quantity of output.

Different combos of inputs might produce a good, but only one is efficient.

If it's impossible to produce a good by decreasing any input (all others constant), then it's efficient. 

#### Economic Efficiency

Occurs when a firm produces a given quantity at the least cost; depends on the relative costs of capital and labour.


#### Summary

Technological - Quantity of inputs used

Economic - Cost of inputs used

Economically Efficient => Technologically Efficient, not vice versa. 

## Information and Organization

Firms organize production using two systems:
- Command
- Incentive

Most firms use a mix of the two. Command is usually used when it's easy to monitor performance, or a small deviation from ideal conditions is costly. Incentives are used when monitoring is hard/costly.

#### Command Systems
These use managerial hierarchies - commands pass down, info/feedback up. They are rigid systems, and can have many layers.

#### Incentive Systems
A method that uses a market-like system to get workers to work in ways to maximize profit.

### Principal-Agent Problem
The problem of devising compensation rules to get an agent to act in the best interests of a principal (eg. Stockholders = Principals; Managers = Agents)

Three solutions:
- Ownership
- Incentive Pay
- Long-term Contracts

#### Ownership
Incentive often given to managers to maximize the firm's profits.

#### Incentive Pay
Links manager/employee wages to firm performance - aligns agent/principal goals.

#### Long Term Contracts
Ties manager/employee long term rewards to the firm's long-term performance.

### Business Organization
- Sole proprietorship
- Partnership
- Corporation

#### Sole proprietorship
- One owner, unlimited liability. They make management decisions and receive profit. Profits are taxed as per normal income.

- Easy to setup
- Decision making is simple
- Profits taxed once.
- Bad decisions not reviewed.
- Personal wealth at stake.
- Firm dies with owner.
- Cost of capital/labour is high.

#### Partnership
- 2+ owners, unlimted liability. Partners must agree on a management structure/profit divisions. Profits are taxed as normal income.

- Easy to setup
- Diverse decision making
- Can survive withdrawal of a partner
- Profit taxed once
- Consensus over managerial decisions hard
- Personal wealth at stake
- Capital is expensive


#### Corporation
- 1+ owners, limited liability (only up to the initial value of their investment). Personal wealth is not at risk. Profits are taxed twice - corporate tax on profits, income taxes on stockholders on dividends.

- Limited Liability
- Lots of cheap capital available
- Professional management
- Lower cost from long-term labour contracts
- Complex management can lead to slow/expensive ops
- Profits taxed twice.

## Markets and the Competitive Environment
1. Perfect Competition
2. Monopolistic Competition
3. Oligopoly
4. Monopoly

#### Perfect Competition
Eg. Wheat, Corn, grains.

- Many firms/buyers
- All firms sell an identical product
- No restrictions on entry of new firms
- Firms/buyers are well informed about prices/products

#### Monopolistic Competition
- Many firms
- Firms produce similar but slightly different products (**product differentiation**)
- Each firm has some market power
- No restrictions on new firms

#### Oligopoly
- Small numbers of firms compete
- Firms produce similar/slightly different prodcts
- Barriers exist to enter the market

#### Monopoly
- One firm produces all the output in the industry
- No close substitutes
- Barriers to entry that prevent competition

### Measures of Concentration
- the four-firm concentration ratio
- The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)

#### Four Firm Concetration Ratio
Percentage of total industry sales by the 4 largest firms in the industry.

#### Herfindahl-Hirschman Index
The square of percentage market share of each firm summed over the largest 50 firms in the industry.

The larger the measure, the less competition that exists.

#### Limits of Concetration Measures
The main limits of using concentration measures as determinants are:
- Geographical Scope
- Barriers to entry/firm turnover
- Correspondence between a market and industry

## Produce or Outsource? Firms and Markets
#### Firm Coordination
Firms hire labour, capital, and land, and by using command/incentive systems, produce goods and services.

#### Market Coordination
Markets coordinate product by adjusting prices and making the decisions of buyers/sellers of factors of production and components consistent.

Outsourcing (buying from other firms) is an example of market coordination, but firms coordinate more production than markets. 

#### Firms
Firms coordinate production when it's more efficient than the market, reasons may be:

- Lower transaction costs (costs of doing business with others)
- Economies of scale (costs of production fall as output increases)
- Economies of scope (specialized inputs produce a range of goods at lower cost)
- Economies of team production (team members specialize in mutually beneficial tasks)
