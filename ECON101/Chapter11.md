# Output and Costs
## Decision Time Frames
Firms make many decisions to maximize profit - many are critical to survival, some are irreversable, some are neither. Decisions can be categorized into short-run and long-run.

#### Short Run
A time frame where the quantity of 1+ resources is fixed. For most firms, capital (the plant) is fixed. Other resources like labour, raw materials, and energy can be changed. These decisions are easily changed.

#### Long Run
A time frame where quantities of all resources (including plant) can be varied. Decisions not easily changed. A **sunk cost** is a cost incurred which cannot be changed. If a plant has no resale value, the amount paid is a sunk cost. Sunk costs are irrelevant to current decisions.

## Short Run Technology Constraint
To increase output in the short run, we need more labour employed.

### Product Schedules
Concepts that describe the relationship between output/quantity of labour employed:
1. Total Product (total output produced)
2. Marginal Product (change in product resulting from a one-unit increase in quantity of labour employed - all else constant)
3. Average Product (total product / quantity of employed labour)

As quantity of labour increases:
- Total product increases
- Marginal product increases initially, then decreases
- Average product decreases

### Product Curves
- Shows firm's total/marginal/average product change against quantity of labour employed

#### Total Product Curve
Output against Labour. Area below is attainable, outside is not. Similar to a PPF in that it's a boundary.

#### Marginal Product Curve
Shows the relation between the marginal product curve and the total product curve.

We draw a Total Product Curve, and then bars between the points to show the marginal product. 

To graph the marginal product, we can do a simple bar graph side by side, instead of what we did earlier. The marginal product of labour curve passes through the midpoints of these bars.

On this graph, we see increasing marginal returns originally, then diminishing marginal returns.

Increasing marginal returns are from increased specialization/division of labour. Diminishing returns are due to less access to capital and less space per worker.

**Law of Diminishing Returns** - As a firm uses more of a variable input with a fixed quantity of other inputs; the marginal product of the variable input diminishes.

#### Average Product Curve
Average product is plotted as a line graph on each point. When marginal product exceeds average product, average product increases and vice versa. When they are equal, average product is at the **maximum**. 

## Short Run Cost
To increase output in the short run, we need more labour (and cost).
- Total Cost
- Marginal Cost
- Average Cost

### Total Cost
- Total Cost (TC) is the cost of ALL resources.
- Total fixed cost (TFC) is the cost of fixed inputs (does NOT change with outputs)
- Total Variable Cost (TVC) is the cost of variable inputs (do change with outputs)

TC = TFC + TVC

On a graph, TFC is a horizontal line, TVC varies; TC is the vertical sum.

The AVC curve gets its shape from the TP curve (steep at low output, less steep at high output), whereas TVC is less steep at low outputs and steep at high outputs. 

If we swap the TP curve's x-axis (quantity of labour) to cost and adjust the units(multiply by cost/quantity of labour), we get a TVC curve.

### Marginal Cost
MC is the increase in total cost that results from a one-unit increase in total product.

Over the output range with increasing marginal returns, the marginal cost falls as output increases and vice versa.

### Average Cost
- AFC - TFC/units of output
- AVC - TVC/units of output
- ATC - TC/units of output

ATC = AFC + AVC

AFC falls as output increases. 

AVC falls to a minimum and then increases. (U-Shaped)

ATC is also U-Shaped.

When AVC is falling, MC is below AVC; vice-versa. When MC = AVC, AVC is at its min. This also holds true for ATC. (falling = 2nd derivative is negative, not slope). This is because MP initally exceeds AP, which increases AP and lowers AVC. Then, MP falls below AP which lowers AP and increases AVC (same for ATC).

ATC is the vertical sum of AFC and AVC. It's also U shaped as:
1. AFC falls over time due to more output
2. Dimishing returns - AVC slopes upwards and increases more than AFC decreases. 

The shape of these curves are determined by the technology a company uses.

- MC is at min when MP is at max
- When MP rises, MC falls
- AVC is at min when AP is at max
- When AP rises, AVC falls

### Shift in Curves
Influenced by:
- Technology
- Prices in factors of production

#### Technology
Influences both product and cost curves. An increase in productivity shifts the product curve up and the cost curve. If a tech advance results in more capital and less labour, FC rises, VC falls, ATC is higher at low output and lower at high output.

#### Prices of Factors of Production
An increase will increase costs and shift the cost curve. An increase in a fixed cost shifts TC and ATC up, but does not change MC. An increase in a variable cost shifts TC, ATC, and MC up.

## Long Run Cost
All inputs and costs are variable.

#### The Production Function
The behaviour of long run cost depends on this. It is the relationship between max attainable output and the quantity of capital and labour.

As the size of the plant increases, the output by fixed labour increases. Law of diminishing returns applies to labour. 

#### Diminishing Marginal Product of Capital
The MP of Capital is the increase in output due to a one-unit increase in capital, labour constant. For each plant, diminishing MP of labour creates short run, U-shaped cost curves for MC, AVC, and ATC. 

#### Short and Long Run Cost 
The AC of producing a given output varies on the plant. The larger the plant, the greater the output is when ATC is at a min. 

For example, the firm has 4 different plants: 1-4 knitting machines - each has a different ATC. As we increase the # of machines, the curve shifts right (more output per cost). 

If we're looking at producing 13 sweaters, 2 machines is the cheapest.

#### Long Run Average Cost Curve (LRAC)
The relationship between the lowest attainable ATC and output when plant and labour are varied. A planning curve that tells the firm the plant that minimizes the cost of producing an **output range**. 

the LRAC curve shows the plant that gives lowest cost per range (made up of several ATCs). 

#### Economies and Diseconomies of Scale
**Economies of scale** - features of a firm's tech that leads to falling long-run AC as output increases.

**Diseconomies of scale** - firm's tech that increases LRAC as output increases.

**Constant Returns to scale** - Tech that leads to constant LRAC as output increases. 

#### Minimum Efficient Scale
Firms experience economies of scale up to some output level; beyond that, it transitions to constant returns or diseconomies of scale.

**Minimum Efficient Scale** is the smallest quantity of output when the LRAC reaches the lowest level. If the LRAC is u-shaped, the min point is the min efficient scale output level.
