# Utility and Demand

## Consumption Choices 
The choices made by buyers are influenced by:
- Consumption possibilities (things that we can afford)
- Preferences

Lisa buys movies and pop. 
#### A consumer's Budget Line
Consumption Possibility Limits: Income, Price of Movie, Price of Pop. When she spends all of her income, she reaches the limits of her consumption possiblilities. Her **budget line** shows this. If she has $4, movies are $8, pop is $4/case, then there are different ways to spend this. 

#### Preferences
The choice Lisa makes depends on her perferences. The benefits she gets from consuming a good/service is her **utility**. 

**Total Utility** - Total benefit from consumption.

## Maximizing Utility
Total utility increases as the quantity increases (of a good). 

#### Marginal Utility
Change in total utility from an unit-increase in quantity consumed. As quantity increases, marginal utility falls. **Diminishing Marginal Utility**. 

Total Utility and Marginal Utility can both be graphed, total utility as a line, and marginal utility as a bar between individual points on the line. 

## Utility-Maximizing Choice
Assume: Households choose the possibility that maximizes total utility. 

#### Spreadsheet Solution
Use a spreadsheet and do the calculations.
- Find the just-affordable combinations
- Find the total utility for each combination
- The utility-maximizing combo is the consumer's choice

#### Find Just-Affordable Combinations
With $40 a month, $8 for a movie, $4 for a case, we can come up with a table for possibilities with $40. 

#### Find Total Utility for each combo
Find the utility for each quantity of movies/pop. 

#### Consumer Equilibrium
Choose the combo that gives the max utility (movies + pop).

Occurs when Lisa has spent all income for the most utility. 

#### Choosing at the Margin
**Marginal Utility per Dollar** - Marginal utility from a good from spending one more dollar. (Marginal Utility / Price) 

By comparing the MUD for Pop and Pizza, we can see if Lisa has allocated her budget in the max way. 

#### Utility-Maximizing Rule
- Spent all available income
- Equalize the MUD for all goods

Choose a row (or point on the budget line). Find one where MUD is equal - that is max utility.

## Predictions of Marginal Utility Theory
#### Fall in Price of Movies
If the price of a good falls, the quantity demanded increases and MUD increases. Then, restore MUD equality. 

The change in price of one good changes the demand for the other - pop decreases to drive up the MUD, so it matches the one for movies.

That's a movement along the demand curve for movies and a decrease in demand for pop. 

#### Rise in Price of Pop
MUD for pop falls, so we decrease pop consumed to restore equality. That causes a shift along the demand curve for pop. 

#### Rise in Income
Demand for normal goods increase. With the extra money, she spends it on increasing the quantity she can buy. Demand curves shift out. 

#### Paradox of Value
Why is water, essential, cheaper than diamonds, non-essential? We buy a lot of water - the marginal utility is small, but total utility is large; vice-versa for diamonds. MUD is the same for both. 

#### Value and Consumer Surplus
Supply of water is perfectly elastic, water consumed is large and consumer surplus is large. Vice versa for diamonds.

#### Temperature: An Analogy
Utility is similar to temperature. Utility helps us make prediction about consumption choices (temp helps us predict when water turns into ice/steam).

Utility helps us understand why people buy more when a price falls or income increases. 

## New Ways of Explaining Consumer Choices
#### Behavioural Economics
The ways in which limits on the brain's ability to implement rational decisions influence economic behaviour. There are 3 impediments:
- Bounded rationality (faced with uncertainity, consumers cannot rationally make choices and rely on other methods)
- Bounded willpower (less than perfect willpower that prevents us from making a decision we'll regret)
- Bounded self-interest (self-interest that results in us not wanting to help others)

#### Endowment Effect 
People value things more because they own them.

#### Neuroeconomics
The study of the activity in a brain when a person makes an economic decision.

Pre-frontal Cortex - Memory/Data, Rational

Hippocampus - Anxiety/Fear, Irrational

#### Controversy
Should economics focus on the decisions observed or what goes on inside peoples' heads? The former.
