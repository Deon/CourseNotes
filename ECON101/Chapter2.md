# The Economic Problem

**Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)** - The boundary between the combinations of goods and services that can be produced and those that cannot. 

We focus on 2 goods at a time, holding all others constant. We graph the production by putting each good on its own axis. 

We can attain points *on* or *inside* the PPF - no points outside can be attained.

**Production Efficiency* - If we cannot produce more of one good without producing less of another (points on the PPF).

### PPF Tradeoffs

All choices along the PPF are tradeoffs - we have to produce less of one good to produce more of another.


### Efficient Resource Usage

Where the marginal benefit and marginal cost intersect is the most efficient resource production. 

Marginal benefit is given by a seperate graph.

Marginal cost is given by the graph of the opportunity cost (a ratio) of the other good. 

## Economic Growth
The expansion of production possibility (increase in standard of life).

Driven by:
 - Technological Change (new goods / better ways to produce them)
 - Capital Accumulation (growth of capital resources)
 
Growth isn't free - we must allocate resources towards R&D today - so we get less production now, but more in the future.

## Gains from Trade

Someone has a **comparative advantage** in an activity if they can do it at a lower opportunity cost than others.

Someone has an **absolute advantage** if they are more productive than others.

A trade line can be drawn from the PPF to the new point on a graph.
