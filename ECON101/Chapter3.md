# Supply and Demand
## Markets
**Competitive Market** - A market that has many buyers/sellers so no one party can change the price. 

**Money Price** - Money needed to buy a good. 

**Relative Price** - Ratio of a good's money price to the next best alternative good (opportunity cost). 
## Demand
If you demand something - you...

1. Want it.
2. Can afford it.
3. Have made a plan to buy it.

Wants are the desires for goods. 
Demand is a decision about which wants to satisify.

**Quantity Demanded** - The amount consumers plan to buy during a time period at a certain price.

**Law of Demand** - If everything else is the same, the higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded; vice-versa. Two reasons:

1. Substitution Effect
2. Income Effect

**Substitution Effect** - When the relative price (opportunity cost) rises, people look for substitutes instead.

**Income Effect** - When the price rises relative to income, people can't afford to buy as much. 

**Demand** - The relationship between the price/quantity demanded of a good.

**Demand Curve** - Shows the relationship when all other influences are constant. AKA **willingness-and-ability-to-pay** curve - the less available, the more people will pay. Willingness to play is **marginal benefit**.

A rise in price, everything else constant, decreases quantity demanded and shifts up the demand curve; vice-versa.

### Change in Demand
When the buying plans change not due to price, there is a change in demand. When demand increases, the curve shifts right; vice-versa.

The 6 factors are.

1. The price of related goods.
2. Expected future prices
3. Income
4. Expected future income/credit
5. Population
6. Preferences

#### Prices of Related Goods
A **substitute** is a good that can be used in place of another.

A **complement** is a good used with another good.

When the price of a substitute rises or the price of a complement falls, the demand for a good rises. 

#### Expected Future Prices
If prices are expected to rise in the future, demand today rises; shift right.

#### Income

**Normal Good** - As income rises, demand increases.

**Inferior Good** - As income rises, demand decreases.

#### Expected future Income
When income or credit increases in the future, demand may increase now.

#### Population
Larger Population = More demand.

#### Preferences
People with the same income may have different demand if they have different preferencces.

### Movement Along the Demand Curve

If demand increases/decreases then the curve shifts right/left respectively. 

If the price changes, all other constant, the quantity changes and there's movement along the curve. 

## Supply
If a firm supplies a good/service, then the firm:

1. Has the resources/tech to produce it
2. Can profit from producing it
3. Has a plan to produce and sell it

**Resources** and **Tech** determine what's possible to produce. 

**Quantity Supplied** is the amount that produces plan to sell at a certain price.

**The law of supply:** Other things remaining the same, the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied, and vice-versa. 

This results from the general tendency for the marginal cost to increase as the quantitty produced increases. Producers are only willing to produce if at least their marginal cost can be covered. 

**Supply** - The entire relationship between the quantity supplied and the price of a good. 

**Supply Curve** - Shows the relationship between the quantity supplied and the price when all else is constant. AKA **mininum-supply-price curve**. Marginal cost (and thus, the lowest price) increases.

### Change in Supply
There is a change in supply when some influence alters selling plans (other than the price of the good). 

When supply *increases*, the supply curve shifts *right*.

When supply *decreases*, the supply curve shifts *left*. 

The 6 factors: 
- Prices of production factors
- Prices of related goods produced
- Expected future prices
- Number of suppliers
- Technology
- State of nature

#### Prices of Factors of Production
If the price of a production factor rises, the mininum price for producting a quantity of that good rises. This decreases supply and shifts the supply curve left. 

#### Prices of Related Goods Produced
**Substitute in Production** - Another good that can be produced using the same resources.

The supply of a good increases if the price of a substitute in production falls. 

**Complements in production** - Goods that must be produced together.

The supply of a good increases if the price of a complement in production rises. 

#### Expected Future Prices
If the price of a good is expected to rise in the future, supply today falls and the supply curve shifts left.

#### The Number of Suppliers
More suppliers = More supply, shifting the supply curve right.

#### Technology
Better technology = More supply, shifts the supply curve right.

#### State of Nature
Natural disasters reduce supply, shifting the curve left. 

### Movement along the supply curve
- More supplied if prices go up, less if prices go down

### Shift of the Supply Curve
- Price stays the same but other factors change
- Left if supply decreases
- Right if supply increases

## Market Equilibrium
Occurs when the price is a balance between buyers' and sellers' plans. 

**Equilibrium Price** - Price when quantity demanded = quantity supplied

**Equilibrium Quantity** - Quantity bought/sold at the Equilibrium price.

Price adjusts when plans don't match.

If a price > equilibrium price, there is a *surplus* and the prices fall. If price < equilibrium price, there is a *deficit* and the prices rise. 

## Predicting Changes in Price and Quantity

As demand rises, the demand curve shifts right. There is now a shortage at the old price, so the quantity supplied rises along with prices; vice-versa. 

As supply increases, the supply curve shifts right. There is now a surplus at the old price, so quantity supplied rises and prices fall; vice-versa.

A change in demand and supply changes the equilbrium price/quantity. 

An increase in both will increase the quantity; and vice-versa. The price is unpredictable.

A decrease in demand and increase in supply lowers the equilbrium price; and vice-versa. Quantity is unpredictable.
