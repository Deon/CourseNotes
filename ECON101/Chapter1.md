- Rational Choice - Compares cost and benefit, and chooses the option with the best benefit over cost. This applies for the person making the choice - it's *their* benefit.
- Benefit - What you gain, pleasure. 
- Opportunity Cost - The highest value alternative that must be given up for another choice. 
- Marginal Benefit - The benefit from pursuing an increase in an activity.
- Marginal Cost - The opportunity cost from persuing an increase in an activity.
- If Marginal Benefit > Marginal Cost, the rational choice is to do more of that activity. 
Choices respond to incentives.
