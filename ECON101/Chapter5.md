# Efficiency and Equity
## Resource Allocation Methods
Let's take a look at a few ways to allocate resources.
#### Market Price
Most resources are allocated this way, usually doing a good job. 

When scarce resources are allocated by the market, the people who get it are those who are willing to pay market price. 

#### Command
Resources are allocated by the order/command of an authority. 

Eg. At your job, your boss allocates your time. 

Works well with organizations with heirachies, but not in economies. 

#### Majority Rule
Resources are allocated by the majority of voters. 

Eg. Spending between military/health care. 

Usually used by societies; works well when self-interest has to be reduced and the decision affects many.

#### Contest
Resources are allocated to the winner(s).

Eg. Sporting events, Awards (Oscars).

Works well when competitors are hard to reward directly.

#### First-Come, First-Served
Resources are allocated to those who are first. 

Eg. Restaurant seating, supermarket lines.

Works well when resources can only serve in sequence.

#### Lottery
Resources are allocated to those who have the winning number (for example).

Eg. Lotteries/Casinos, landing slots at airports, starting spaces in races.

Works well when there's no good way to distinguish among users of a resource.

#### Personal Characteristics
Resources are allocated to those with the 'right' characteristics.

Eg. Choosing a marriage partner.

Almost always used in the wrong way (basis of race, sexism, etc.)

#### Force
Theft - taking stuff from others, war, etc.

Effective way of allocating resources (eg. taking money from the rich to give to the poor). 

## Benefit, Cost, and Surplus
### Demand, Willingness to Pay, Value
Value - what we get.

Price - what we pay.

The value of one more unit is its marginal benefit. Value is the max price that someone's willing to pay, which determines demand.

Demand curve = marginal benefit curve.

### Individual & Market Demand
- The relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded by a person is *individual demand*
- For all buyers, that's the *market demand*

The market demand curve is the *horizontal sum* of the individual demand curves.


### Consumer Surplus
The excess of the benefit received from a good over the amount paid.

Consumer Surplus = (Marginal Benefit + Value - Price) / Quantity Bought

The area under the demand curve, above the price paid, up to the quantity bought (left -> right).

### Supply and Marginal Cost 
Firms are here to make profits, when price > cost. 
### Supply Cost, Minumum Supply-Price
Cost - what producers give up.

Price - what producers receive.

Cost of one more good/service is the marginal cost and the min price the firm is willing to accept, which determines supply.

Supply curves are marginal cost curves.

### Individual/Market Supply
Individual Supply - Relationship of a good/quantity supplied for one producer.

Market Supply - Individual Supply for all producers.

The market supply curve is the *horizontal sum* of the individual supply curves.

### Producer Surplus
Excess of the amount received over the cost of production.

Producer Surplus = (Price - Marginal Cost)/Quantity Sold

The area below the market price and above the supply curve, summed over the quantity sold. 

## Is the Competitive Market Efficient?
A competitive market has efficient allocations at equilbrium.

When production is...
- Less than equilibrium, Marginal Social Benefit > Marginal Social Cost
- More than equilibrium, Marginal Social Benefit < Marginal Social Cost
- At Equilibrium, Marginal Social Benefit = Marginal Social Cost

At efficient levels, Total Surplus (CS + PS) is maximized. 

Consumers and Producers both pursue self-interest in market interactions. 

### Market Failure
Markets aren't always efficient. Market Failure occurs when it is inefficient. It could be because of over/underproduction.

#### Underproduction
Efficient Quantity - 10K Pizzas / Day
If we restrict the production to 5K, the area from 5K-10K on the graph is now a *deadweight loss* - the decrease in total surplus. That's a *social loss*.

#### Overproduction
If we expand production to 15K, we get a deadweight loss from overproduction (the area from 10K - 15K), resulting in another social loss. 

### Sources of Market Failure
#### Price/Quantity Regulations
Price regulations put blocks on price adjustments and lead to underproduction.

Quantity regulations limit the amount that can be produced and can also lead to underproduction.

#### Taxes and Subsidies
Taxes increase prices paid by buyers, lower prices received by sellers. They decrease the quantity produced and lead to underproduction.

Subsidies do the opposite and can lead to overproduction.

#### Externalities
A cost or benefit that affects someone other than the buyer/seller. 

Electric utilities create an external cost (eg. Acid Rain) - this cost isn't considered when choosing the amount to produce, resulting in overproduction.

An apartment owener would have a marginal benefit from installing a smoke detector and doesn't consider her neighbour's marginal benefit - deciding not to install a smoke detector. Underproduction occurs.

#### Public Goods and Common Resources
A public good benefits everyone. It's in everyone's self-interest to not pay for this, leading to underproduction (free-rider problem).

Common resources are owned by no one and used by everyone - it's in everyone's self interest to ignore these costs(tragedy of the commons) resulting in overproduction. 

#### Monopoly
A firm that is the sole provider of a good/service. Their self interset is to maximize profit, setting their own prices, leading to underproduction.

#### High Transactions Costs
The opportunity cost of making trades. To use the market price as an allocator of scarce resources, it is worth bearing these costs.

If transactions costs are too high, the market may underproduce.

### Alternatives to the Market
When a market is inefficient, can another allocation method work? 

These is no one efficient mechanism.

## Is the Competitive Market Fair?
There's two groups about fairness:
- It's not fair if the results aren't fair.
- It's not fair if the rules aren't fair. 

###It's not fair if the results aren't fair.

Utilitarianism - Equality brings efficiency. We should strive for the greatest happiness for the greatest number.

If everyone gets the same marginal utility from a given income and the marginal benefit of income decreases as income rises, then taking a dollar from a richer person and giving it to a poorer person increases total benefit. Only when income has been equally distributed has the greatest happiness been achieved.

Ex. Tom is poor, has high marginal benefit of income; vice-versa with Jerry. Jerry giving Tom money (until it's equal) will increase total benefit.

**The Big Tradeoff**
Utilitarianism ignores the cost of income transfers. It's a tradeoff between efficiency and fairness. John Rawls proposed that income should be redistributed to the point when the poorest person is as well off as possible.

### It's not fair if the rules aren't fair.
Symmetry Principle - People in similar situations should be treated similarly. 

This means equality of opportunity.

Robery Nozick suggested two rules for this:
1. The state must create/enforce laws that establish/protect private property.
2. Private Property may be transferred from one person to another only by voluntary exchange. 

If all resources are allocated efficiently, they also may be allocated fairly.
