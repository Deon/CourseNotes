# Possibilities, Preferences, Choices.

## Consumption Possibilities
Choices are limited by income, and prices of goods/services, described by the budget line (Chapter 8). Anything within the budget line can be afforded, but nothing outside (like the PPF).

### The Budget Equation
Expenses = Income

P = Price, Q = Quantity, Y = Income (p = pop, m = movies)

PpQp + PmQm = Y

Qp = Y/Pp - (Pm/Pp)Qm

Y/Pp = Real income in terms of pop - income expressed as a quantity of goods affordable. 

Pm/Pp = Relative Price of a movie in terms of pop. Price of one good/price of another good. 

#### A Change in Prices
A rise in the price on the x-axis (Qm vs Qp) decreases Q and increases the slope. 

#### A Change in Income
Causes a parallel shift outwards. The slope doesn't change as the relative price is constant. 

## Preference and Indifference Curves
A line that shows combos of goods among which a consumer is indifferent. It joins the points that are as good as each other. 

Combos can be sorted into:
- Preferred
- Not Preferred
- Just as Good

All points on it are just as good, the ones above preferred, the ones below not preferred. 

A **preference map** shows a series of indifference curves. We'll prefer the ones above always, regardless of which point on which curve. 

#### Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)
The rate that a person will give up goof y to get an additional good x while remaining indifferent. This depends on the slope of the curve. If it's steep, the MRS is high (they'll give up a lot of y to get x), and if flat, vice versa. 

#### Diminishing MRS
The key assumption of consumer theory.

A diminishing MRS is a tendency for a person to give up less of y to get x, remaining indifferent.

On a MRS that decreases, at smaller values they'll give up more y to get x, at larger values, they'll give up less. 

#### Degree of Substitutability
The shape reveals the degree of substitutability. 

- Ordinary - A curve
- Perfect Substitutes - A straight line
- Perfect Complements - line that turns at a 90 degree angle at a point

## Predicting Consumer Choices
#### Best Affordable Choice
- On the budget line
- On the highest attainable indifference curve
- MRS = Relative Price

If the point is higher than expected on the budget line, the MRS is greater than relative price and vice versa. 

#### A Change in Price
The Price Effect - effect of a change in price on the quantity consumed.

The budget line moves outwards (for example), then we can choose another point on the budget line, and we shift on the demand curve.

#### A Change in Income
The Income Effect - effect of a change in income on the quantity consumed.

The budget line shifts parallel outwards, the demand curve shifts left. 

### Substitution and Income Effect
A fall in price always increases quantity consumed - the price effect can be divided into the substitution and income effects.

#### Substitution Effect
The effect of a change in price on the quantity when the customer remains on the same indifference curve.

Let's say Lisa gets a pay cut and the price of movies falls, the budget line shifts downwards and she can buy more movies. When the relative price falls, more of that good gets substituted. 

#### Income Effect
Income back to usual, price of movies falls. She now sees more movies as she has more income - the income effect is positive and reinforces the substitution effect. 

#### Inferior Goods
When income increases, the quantity bought decreases. The income effect is negative and works against the substitution effect. As long as the substitution effect dominates, the demand curve slopes down. If the negative income effect dominates, the lower price decreases the quantity demanded and the demand curve slopes up.
