# Elasticity

## Price Elasticity of Demand
Supply Decreases = Equilibrium price rises, quantity decreases. 

But... how much does it change by? What is its responsiveness?

Let's look at the slope of the demand curve - if it's steep, prices rise by a lot. If it's flat, prices rise a little. 

Elasticity is a unitless measure of responsiveness. 

The price elasticity of demand is a unitless measure of quantity demanded due to a change in price. 

% change in Quantity / % change in price = (change in Q/average Q)/ (change in $/average $)

#### Average Price & Quantity
By using averages, we get the same value if it rises or falls. 

#### Unit-free Measure
Elasticity is a ratio of precentages - a change in units leaves the ratio the same. 

#### Minus Sign and Elasticity
The formula yields a negative as they move in opposite directions - the magintude shows how responsive it is.   

### Inelastic and Elastic demand

Demand can be inelastic, unit elastic, or elastic (ranging from 0 -> infinity). 

If the quantity demanded does not change when the price changes, the price elasticity of demand is 0 and is perfectly inelastic. The demand curve is vertical (price vs quantity).

If the percentage change in quantity demanded = percentage change in price, the price elasticity of demand = 1 and is unit elastic. The demand curve has a declining slope.

**Inelastic Demand** - Price Elasticity of Demand < 1 

**Elastic Demand** - Price Elasticity of Demand > 1

If the quantity demanded can change a lot when the price does not change, the price elasticity is infinite and is perfectly elastic. On a demand curve, it's a horizontal line.

### Factors that Influence the Elasticity of Demand

- The Closeness of Substitutes
- The Proportion of income spent on the good
- The time elapsed since a price change.

#### Closeness of Substitutes
The closer the substitutes, the more elastic the demand. 

Inelastic - Food, Housing.

Elastic - Luxuries. 

#### Proportion of Income Spent on the Good
The greater the proportion of income that consumers spend on a good, the more elastic it is. 

#### Time Elapsed Since Price Change
The more time consumers have to adjust to a price change, or the longer a good has before losing its value, the more elastic it is.

### Elasticity among a Linear Demand Curve
- At the midpoint of the demand curve, demand is unit elastic. 
- It varies elsewhere - at prices > the midpoint, demand is elastic.
- At prices < the midpoint, the demand is inelastic.

### Total Revenues and Elasticity

**Revenue** = Quantity * Price. 

When the price changes, total revenue also changes. A rise in price != more total revenue.

- If demand is *elastic* - a 1% price cut increases quantity sold by more than 1%, revenue increases.
- If demand is *inelastic*, a 1% price cut increases quantity sold by less than 1%, revenue decreases.
- If demand is *unit elastic*, total revenue is unchanged.

#### The Total Revenue Test
A method of estimating the price elasticity of demand by observing the change in total revenue resulting from a price change. 
- If a price cut increases total revenue, the demand is *elastic*
- If a price cut decreases total revenue, the demand is *inelastic*
- If a price cut does not change total revenue, the demand is *unit elastic*

### Your Expenditures and Elasticity
- If demand is *elastic*, a 1% price cut increases quantity by more than 1%, increasing expenditures. 
- If demand is *inelastic*, a 1% price cut increases quantity by less than 1%, decreasing expenditures.
- If demand is *unit elastic*, a 1% price cut increases quantity by 1%; expenditures do not change.

## More Elasticities of Demand

### Income Elasticity of Demand
A measure of how the quantity demanded changes relative to a change in income.

= % Change in Quantity Demanded / % Change in Income

- If it is > 1, then it is *income elastic* and is a normal good.
- If it is > 0, < 1, then it is *income inelastic* and is a normal good.
- If it is < 0, then it is an inferior good. 

### Cross Elasticity of Demand
A measure of the responsiveness of demand of a good, given a change of a price of a substitute/complement.

= % Change in Quantity Demanded / % Change in Price of Substitute/Complement

- +ve if a substitute
- -ve if a complement

## Elasticity of Supply
When the demand of a good increases, the equilibrium price rises and the equilibrium quantity increases as well. But how much does it increase by? That depends on the *elasticity of supply*

It measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in the price of the good. 

= % change in quantity supplied / % change in price

It is...
- **perfectly inelastic** if the supply curve is vertical (0)
- **elastic** > 1
- **unit elastic** if the supply curve is linear and passes through the origin (slope is irrelevant)
- **inelastic** < 1
- **perfectly elastic** if the curve is horizontal (infinite)

Influencing Factors:
- Resource Substitution Possibilities
- Timeframe for Supply Decision

#### Resource Substitution Possibilities
The easier it is to substitute the resources used to produce a good/service, the greater its elasticity of supply. 

#### Timeframe for Supply Decision
The more time that passes after a price change, the greater its elasticity of supply.

- *momentary supply* - perfectly inelastic.
- *short-run supply* - somewhat elastic.
- *long-run supply* - most elastic.
